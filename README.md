# HSFW: Hyper Synced Files Workspace

Dropbox-like p2p file syncing built on [Hypercore's new multiwriter Autobase](https://github.com/hypercore-protocol/autobase).

**Not yet published to npm**

## TODOs

- [Externalizing blobs to a separate storage and transfer protocol](https://github.com/pfrazee/hyper-sfw/issues/1)
- [Decaching old core messages](https://github.com/pfrazee/hyper-sfw/issues/2)
- Writer management (waiting on autoboot)
- Events / reactive APIs
- BUG: In multiple cases, I needed to read the current state to ensure sync between writers (look for HACKs in code)

## Example usage

```typescript
import { Workspace } from 'hsfw'

const ws = await Workspace.createNew(corestore)
const ws = await Workspace.load(corestore, workspacePublicKey)

// basic file ops
// =

await ws.writeFile('/file.txt', 'Hello, world!')
await ws.statFile('/file.txt') /* => {
  path: '/file.txt',
  timestamp: Date(January 1, 1969),
  bytes: 13,
  writer: Buffer<...>,
  change: 'b3c316fdc136bde5',
  conflict: false,
  noMerge: false
  otherChanges: []
} */
await ws.listFiles() // => [{...}]
await ws.readFile('/file.txt', 'utf-8') // => 'Hello, world!'

await ws.copyFile('/file.txt', '/file2.txt')
await ws.moveFile('/file2.txt', '/file3.txt')
await ws.deleteFile('/file3.txt')

// history
// =

await ws.listHistory()
await ws.listHistory({path: '/directory/*'})
await ws.listHistory({path: '/file.txt'})
```

## Implementation notes

### Hypercore schemas

The repo is an Autobase which uses oplog inputs and a Hyperbee for the index. All data is encoded using msgpack.

The Hyperbee index uses the following layout:

```
/_meta = Meta
/files/{...path: string} = IndexedFile
/changes/{id: string} = IndexedChange
/history/{mlts: string} = string // mlts is a monotonic lexicographic timestamp
/blobs/{hash: string} = {}
/blobchunks/{hash: string}/{chunk: number} = Buffer

IndexedChange {
  id: string // random generated ID
  parents: string[] // IDs of changes which preceded this change
  writer: Buffer // key of the core that authored the change
  
  path: string // path of file being changed
  timestamp: Date // local clock time of change
  details: ChangeOpPut|ChangeOpCopy|ChangeOpDel
}

IndexedFile {
  path: string // path of the file in the tree
  timestamp: Date // local clock time of change
  bytes: number // number of bytes in this blob (0 if delete or move)

  writer: Buffer // key of the core that authored the change
  blob: string|undefined // blob sha256 hash

  change: string // last change id
  noMerge: boolean // in no-merge mode?
  otherChanges: string[] // other current change ids
}
```

The oplogs include one of the following message types:

```
SetMetaOp {
  op: 1
  schema: string
  writerKeys: Buffer[]
}

ChangeOp {
  op: 2
  id: string // random generated ID
  parents: string[] // IDs of changes which preceded this change
  path: string // path of file being changed
  timestamp: Date // local clock time of change
  details: ChangeOpPut|ChangeOpCopy|ChangeOpDel

  ChangeOpPut {
    action: number // OP_CHANGE_ACT_PUT
    blob: string // sha256 hash of blob to create
    bytes: number // number of bytes in this blob
    chunks: number // number of chunks in the blob (will follow this op)
    noMerge: boolean // is this a "no merge" put?
  }

  ChangeOpCopy {
    action: number // OP_CHANGE_ACT_COPY
    blob: string // sha256 hash of blob to copy
    bytes: number // number of bytes in this blob
  }

  ChangeOpDel {
    action: number // OP_CHANGE_ACT_DEL
  }
}

BlobChunkOp {
  op: 3
  blob: string // sha256 hash of blob
  chunk: number // chunk number
  value: Buffer
}
```

### Folder behaviors

Folders are created automatically based on paths. SFW does not prohibit files from being created which conflict with a folder name.

Changes to a folder (renames, moves, deletes) must be written as individual `Change` messages for each file.

### Detecting conflicts in changes

All change operations have a random ID and list the parent changes by their ID. When the indexer handles a change, it compares the listed parents to the current file's "head changes." If one of the head changes is not included in the list of parents, the file is put in conflict state. Conflict state is tracked by a list of change numbers in the file entry.

### No-merge writes

You can write a file with the `noMerge` option set to true. This circumvents the merging behavior, essentially causing the file to go into "conflict" on purpose. (SFW notes that it is a `noMerge` write and accordingly doesn't indicate the write as a conflict.)

Non-merged files essentially maintain separate copies for each writer. You can fetch each writer's copy using `readAllFileStates()`.

This is particularly useful for [Y.js](https://yjs.dev), as each writer's state updates can be written separately and then merged on read.

```js
import * as Y from 'yjs'

const ydoc = new Y.Doc()
ydoc.getText().insert(0, 'Hello, world!')

// write the state update in "no merge" mode
await ws.writeFile('/ydoc.txt', Buffer.from(Y.encodeStateAsUpdate(ydoc)), {noMerge: true})

// now create another ydoc instance and read each writer's updates into it
const ydoc2 = new Y.Doc()
const state = await ws.readAllFileStates('/ydoc.txt')
for (const item of state) Y.applyUpdate(ydoc2, item.data)
String(ydoc2.getText()) // 'Hello, world!'
```
